### Hi everyone! 👋

My name is Rodrigo Azevedo, from Brazil (🇧🇷). Currently, I work as a Java developer at UFAM, I have knowledge in front-end, back-end and web applications. In addition, I am an undergraduate Professor at Estácio. I am passionate about technology and its benefits, solutions and possibilities. I made a lot of code mistakes, but I always try to learn and improve a little bit at a time. 😄

In my free time, I like to rollerblade, take care of the garden (🌱), to play with my kids (👧‍👦), watch movies (🎞️), read books (📚), make plans (🤔) and sometimes nothing! (😅)

Would you like to meet me?
