### Hi there 👋

My name is Rodrigo Azevedo, from Brazil (🇧🇷). I have been working as a developer since 2012 and since 2015 I am a Java developer with knowledge in frontend, backend and web applications. I am passionate about technology and its benefits, solutions and possibilities. I've made many code errors but I always try to learn and improve a little bit at a time. 😄

In my free time, I like to rollerblade, take care of the garden (🌱) and play with my kids, watch movies (🎞️), read books (📚), make plans (💬) and sometimes nothing! (🤔)

Would you like to meet me?
